This is a collection of Ansible roles for free software self-hosting.

This collection mainly targets individuals or eventually small companies, but is
done with professional quality standards.

These roles are done with in mind:

* Up to date and fully featured software.
* Security.
* Minimal maintenance.

To achieve well the two first points, [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) is used
as the base OS because it always provides up to date versions of software and
advanced security feature like SELinux by default.
To again improve the security, hardening roles are applied in addition of some
security configuration.
To achieve the minimal maintenance, auto-updates (with auto-reboot, if required)
are set for all packages every day.

Of course, there are always drawbacks with all choices. In that case, it is the
risk of an update that break something and makes the service unavailable.

If you absolutely require a perfectly stable service with a 99.99% availability,
use some other role based on stabler OS like CentOS or Debian and that install
LTS software versions.
No guarantee is provided with the use of these roles.

## FAQ

Why recommend "Fedora Minimal" over "Fedora Server" ?
> Fedora minimal is the Fedora version with the least pre-installed packages.
> Less packages means: less potential security vulnerabilities, less disc space 
> usage, less background services consuming RAM/CPU, less network usage on 
> packages update, ...
>
> To summary, this improves the server security and energy consumption. 
> This can also help when running multiples virtual machines on a same host.
>
> Finally, if the Ansible role is done to work with the minimal version, it
> should work on any version with more packages. 
> So any variant can be freely used, the choice is yours.

Where find "Fedora Minimal" ?
> Fedora Minimal is hidden and not directly provided as ISO on the Fedora 
> website.
>
> To install it, use the `Netinstall ISO image` of "Fedora Server" and select
> "Fedora Minimal" in the `Software Selection` screen.

How to upgrade Fedora when using these roles ?
>A new Fedora version is released every 6 months and it is highly recommended to 
>keep it up to date.
>
>Always ensure to have a back up of your system before upgrading.
>
>Upgrade Fedora as normal (Replace `NEW_VERSION` with the new Fedora version):
>```bash
>sudo dnf upgrade --refresh -y
>sudo dnf system-upgrade download -y --releasever=NEW_VERSION
>sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
>```
>
>Then, simply re-apply your Ansible playbook to ensure everything is OK.
>
>Some components like databases may requires extra steps to upgrade. This is
>specified in the relevant role documentation.
