# Squid Ansible Role

![Ansible Role: "jgoutin.home.squid"](https://github.com/JGoutin/ansible_home/workflows/Ansible%20Role:%20%22jgoutin.home.squid%22/badge.svg)

## Description

This role installs a [Squid](https://www.squid-cache.org) caching proxy.

This proxy allows speeding up internet connection and saving bandwidth.

**Warning:** Pay attention when using the SSL Bump option because it can lead to 
security and privacy issues on your network. With this option, it is recommended 
to restrict the use of the proxy to limited usage like packages updates and avoid using
it as a transparent proxy on your full network or from user's browser. The CA used 
should be dedicated to Squid only.

### Features

Configuration:
* Run Squid as a caching proxy.
* Cache both HTTP and HTTPS requests (With SSL bump feature).
* Optimize the hit ratio of RPM repositories.
* Log in the Systemd journal.

Security:
* Use [modern TLS configuration from Mozilla](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#config=modern).
* Run in a Systemd sandbox.
* Configure the firewall.

## Dependencies

### OS recommendation

* "Fedora minimal" is recommended. 
* "Fedora server" is recommended if its additional functionalities are required.

### Roles

It is also recommended setting the `common_dnf_proxy` variable from the 
[**common**](../common/README.md) role to `http://127.0.0.1:<squid_http_port>`. Doing 
this will make DNF on the Squid host using the caching proxy. The root CA certificate 
can be configured using `common_dnf_sslcacert`.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  collections:
    - jgoutin.home
  roles:
    - common
    - squid
  vars:
    # Set the cache size
    squid_cache_dir_size: 40960

    # Enable SSL bump
    squid_ssl_bump_ca: squiq_ca_key_and_cert.pem

    # Use itself as proxy for DNF
    common_dnf_proxy: http://127.0.0.1:3128
    common_dnf_sslcacert: squid_ca_cert_only.crt
```

## Configuring RPM hit ratio optimization for more repositories

The hit ratio optimization will be automatically configured for any DNF repository 
installed on the Squid host.

Repositories that does not use mirrors (with `metalink`/`mirrorlist` options) or that
only have a single mirror does not require to be optimized and will be properly cached
natively.

To add the support of a new repository, simply install it the squid host.

To add the support of RPMfusion repositories, simply use the 
[**rpmfusion**](../rpmfusion/README.md) role with `rpmfusion_free` & `rpmfusion_nonfree`
variables set to `true`.

The Squid mirror configuration is updated each day, but it is possible to force update 
with `sudo systemctl start squid_dnf_mirrors`.

## Configuring other machines to use the Squid proxy

### Configuring DNF to use the proxy

If your machine is managed with Ansible and the [**common**](../common/README.md) role, 
simply set the `common_dnf_proxy` variable on the machine playbook to 
`http://<squid-host-ip-or-hostname>:<squid_http_port>`.

If you enabled the `squid_ssl_bump_ca` feature, you also need to add the CA certificate
(Without the private key) to the `common_dnf_sslcacert` variable.

Then, apply the playbook.

It is also possible to configure DNF manually by adding the line 
`proxy=http://<squid-host-ip-or-hostname>:<squid_http_port>` to the DNF configuration 
file (`/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`). The SSL bump CA certificate can be configured by adding the
`sslcacert=path_to_squid_ca_cert_only.crt` line.

It is also possible to enable the CA certificate at system-wide level.
This can be useful is the proxy is not used only by DNF.
But it can also be less secure.
